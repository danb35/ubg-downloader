Device to download data from EI UBG-16/MUX-8A

# Introduction
This device developed out of a desire to download data from the [Electronics International](https://www.iflyei.com/) [UBG-16](https://www.iflyei.com/product/ubg-16-ultimate-bar-graph/) in my Mooney aircraft.  EI provide (at an extra cost) a serial cable and software you can install on your laptop, but I didn't want to need to drag a laptop out to the plane to download data; I wanted a small, battery-operated device that would download the data onto an SD card.  This device will do that.

# Status
This project is *archived.*  I no longer have the airplane or any of the EI hardware to test with.  The software and hardware documentation are provided here for anyone to use, and to build on if desired, but I won't be able to provide much in the way of support.  Primary development took place in 2012, so my memory may not be too clear about the details.

But with that said, it worked.  Once the clock was set (I never did get around to developing a UI to do that through the device's software itself), it was just a matter of inserting a couple of AA batteries, plugging it into the plane with a 1/8" stereo audio cable, and downloading.  If you can source the parts and assemble the PCB, it should work for you as well.
